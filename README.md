# [Comparing Classification Models](https://github.com/dandersonghub/Classification-Models/blob/main/DA_Case_Study.ipynb)
The analysis project aims to understand the association between provider's registration status and their demographic, geographic, communication, and behavioral characteristics, specifically comparing registered and unregistered providers. A machine learning algorithm was trained using Python's Sklearn library to predict the provider registration status, and four different classification models were built and evaluated for accuracy to determine the best model. The Gradient Boosting Machine model was found to have the highest degree of accuracy (90%) and the most significant features were found to be sanction count and location count. The final model selected was GBM due to its slightly better performance compared to other tree-based models. The model can be further optimized by tuning hyperparameters, comparing additional classifiers, or adding more data.
