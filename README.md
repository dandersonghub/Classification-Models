# [Comparing Classification Models](https://github.com/dandersonghub/Classification-Models/blob/main/DA_Case_Study.ipynb)
This project compares and evaluates the performance of multiple binary classification models on their ability to predict the registration status of medical providers (registered or unregistered). The goal of this analysis is to understand the association between a provider's registration status and their demographic, geographic, communication, and behavioral characteristics. Four classification algorithms were built and trained to predict the provider registration status, and the performance of each model was evaluated based on six key accuracy metrics. After comparing all 4 models, the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) was found to be the best-performing model with the highest degree of accuracy (90%). The sanction count and location count were discovered to be the two most important features.The model can be further enhanced to produce better results by tuning hyperparameters, comparing different classifiers, or incorporating additional data.
